Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Developer from Wellington, New Zealand.

I regularly play with Java, Kotlin, Angular, and a variety of other technology's.

Like most developers I have a pretty large back catalogue of started and abandoned projects. I like building things, but also tend to let usefulness guide my efforts. My small home lab isn't built to experiment with technologies, but rather to serve a need. My library management software was built with the need to stop buying duplicate Art books.
